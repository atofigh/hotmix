hotmix depends on the following libraries (versions that hotmix was
tested with are given in parentheses):

boost (1.34)
gmp (4.2.3)
mpfr (2.3.0)
mpfrcpp (1.4.2)
NHparser (0.9.0) (https://github.com/atofigh/NHparser)

First you will need to obtain and install those libraries. Then edit the
Makefile as needed (e.g., to set paths if the above libraries are
installed in non-standard locations). Then do

$ make

This should produce the following binaries that you can copy anywhere
you like:

hotmix
gen_rand_hot
gen_data
likelihood
parent

See the README file for brief information on usage.
